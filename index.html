 <h2>Facts</h2>
    <div>Whales are the largest animals on Earth and they live in every ocean. 
    The massive mammals range from the 600-pound dwarf sperm whale to the 
    colossal blue whale, which can weigh more than 200 tons and stretch up to 
    100 feet longâ€”almost as long as a professional basketball court.

    Whales are warm-blooded creatures that nurse their young.<div></div>

### Guide

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account. *You can name this repository whatever you would like.*
2. Once inside of the repository, create a new file and name it `index.html`
3. Add your HTML into this file, save it, and then navigate into your repository's `Settings` tab.
4. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled `Source`, select that you would like to use the `master` branch as your source.
5. Navigate to `<<YOUR USERNAME>>.github.io/<<REPO NAME YOU CHOSE>>` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (For example, if your GitHub username is `johndoe` and the project is `cssDemo`, your URL would be `johndoe.github.io/cssDemo`)
